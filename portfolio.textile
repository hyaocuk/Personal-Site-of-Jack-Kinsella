h2(#oxbridge_notes). Oxbridge Notes 

"Visit Oxbridge Notes":http://www.oxbridgenotes.co.uk

On online marketplace where students can upload their college notes and sell them, earning a commission on every sale. I built and designed this app from scratch and have maintained it for nearly two years.  

h3. E-Commerce and Design

The website is a heavily modified open source T-shirt e-commerce shop selling digital downloads. Types of notes are sorted by category and key products are displayed here in the homepage.  Buyers add the digital products to the cart just like any e-commerce website and upon payment the notes are automatically delivered to them. No staff are needed to run the website.
 
h3. ABTesting and Conversion Optimisation

!images/oxbridge_notes_abtests.png!

In order to maximize sales I integrated an internal ABtesting system.  The example above shows the results of an ongoing test where 50% of users see one version of the checkout page (with a plain checkout button),  and 50% see another version with a pretty green button. The adminstrator learns not only the result of the test but also whether the results are statistically valid.  

h3. Custom Activity Feed

Administrators of the website can see all key user activities, giving them awareness of how the business is doing, what their users are up to and the ability to anticipate problems.

h3. User Area with File Management

Sellers of notes can manage their inventory in detail. Change they make modify the products within the website. Shown above is one of a screen in their administrative area which lets them delete individual files.

h3. Financial Reporting

The administrator website has an overview of all the orders made over periods of time, broken down by category and by user. Using this data he can decide what products are the best sellers and so ought to be most heavily advertised.
