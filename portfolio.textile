h2(#oxbridge_notes). Oxbridge Notes 

"Visit Oxbridge Notes":http://www.oxbridgenotes.co.uk

On online marketplace where students can upload their college notes and sell them, earning a commission on every sale. I built and designed this app from scratch and have maintained it for nearly two years.  

h3. E-Commerce and Design

The website is a heavily modified open source T-shirt e-commerce shop selling digital downloads. Types of notes are sorted by category and key products are displayed here in the homepage.  Buyers add the digital products to the cart just like any e-commerce website and upon payment the notes are automatically delivered to them. No staff are needed to run the website.
 
h3. ABTesting and Conversion Optimisation

!images/oxbridge_notes_abtests.png!

In order to maximize sales I integrated an internal AB testing system.  The example above shows the results of an ongoing test where 50% of users see one version of the checkout page (with a plain checkout button),  and 50% see another version with a pretty green button. The administrator learns not only the result of the test but also whether the results are statistically valid.  

h3. Custom Activity Feed

Administrators of the website can see all key user activities, giving them awareness of how the business is doing, what their users are up to and the ability to anticipate problems.

h3. User Area with File Management

Sellers of notes can manage their inventory in detail. Change they make modify the products within the website. Shown above is one of a screen in their administrative area which lets them delete individual files.

h3. Financial Reporting

The administrator website has an overview of all the orders made over periods of time, broken down by category and by user. Using this data he can decide what products are the best sellers and so ought to be most heavily advertised.

h2(#second_conscience). Second Conscience

"Visit Second Consience":http://www.secondconscience.com

At the end of every day Benjamin Franklin graded his own adherence of thirteen virtues, attempting to minimize transgressions. This personal project was my attempt to bring this behavioural modification tool into an electronic age. Users add numerous "habits" and attempt to win awards by completing them continuously for extended periods. The website is called second conscience it is an antidote to your own conscience's softness and will harass you with guilt emails if you forget to log on.  The project is not being maintained so it may have degraded somewhat since its inception.

h2(#bolivian_express). Bolivian Express

"Visit Bolivian Express":http://www.bolivianexpress.org

I was the sole developer and designer for Bolivian Express, Bolivia's major English language newspaper. Features include a CMS for articles built using Refinery, and a bespoke system for managing interns hires and payments via Paypal. I did a Rails 2.0 to Rails 3.0 upgrade on the project.

h2(#hired_help). Hired Help

"Visit Hired Help":http://www.hiredhelp.ie

Whilst the project was started by another programmer I took over as lead developer in a team of three and, amongst other things, squashed many latent bugs, added automated tests, and built a bespoke search engine gem for faceted searches.
