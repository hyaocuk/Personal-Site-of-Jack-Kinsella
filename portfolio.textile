h2(#oxbridge_notes). Oxbridge Notes 

On online marketplace where students can upload their college notes and sell them, earning a commission on every sale. I built, and designed this app from scratch and am the only maintainer.

Front page design my own. Key products are displayed on the homepage.  Buyers can visit those pages then add the products to cart. Upon payment the notes are automatically delivered to them.

I added ABingo, an abtest framework into the application, which shows 50% of users one version of the page (in this example, a standard checkout button) and 50% another version (here, a green button) and informs the adminstrator when a statistically valid result has been reached.

Administrators of the website have a bird's eye view of key activities, giving them awareness of how the business is doing and what their users are up to.

Sellers of notes can manage their inventory in detail. Shown above is the screen where they can delete individual files, or even entire products.
