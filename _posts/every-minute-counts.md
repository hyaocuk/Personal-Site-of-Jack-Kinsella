Every Minute Counts: meeting your financial needs faster
WHEREAMI: do not lose the progress of your thoughts

# The Great Freedoms

## 1 Location
For you to be location free doesn't mean self-employed. You could just
find a company willing to set you up that way. My assistants are
location free under the agreement because I know they find the working
conditions excellent and that makes for a happy worker who wants to help
you out and do well. An similar argumeent extended along the same lines
might convince your current employer.

## 2 Number of hours
If you earn a high hourly rate freelancing (say 100/hour as talented iPhone developers with US clients pull in), and your financial needs are modest, then you could, as I know people in Berlin doing, work 2 months solid per year, then take the rest off. It's not a 4HWW per se, but a damn nice arrangement nevertheless.

## 3 Flexibility of when those hours are
If you work only 1 hour a week, but are required, without fail, to be a computer for 1
minute every 4 hours, forgoing sleep, romantic partners, parties or
travel arrangements, then you have dreadful working conditions. I don't
see this point highlighting enough in the 4HWW community, but you ought
to consider 

## 4 Having no superior
Having a superior isn't fun. You have to adapt to their way of doing
things and to people please to some extent. You don't *feel* independent
when someone is telling you what to do and how to do it. Of course
without a superior it means that you must take on ultimate
responsibility for ensuring everything goes smoothly, so you buy this
freedom at a cost to your stress levels. I mention this as a freedom
because I can perceive of situations where you might get the other
freedoms but need to suffer under a superior you do not like. But that
might be an acceptable compromise—or not—depending on personality type.
Perhaps you'd prefer to work 10 instead of 5 hours for the benefit of no boss.

Why the talk of these freedoms? Because you should rank each of these
and figure out what's most important for you, and where you are willing
to compromise. Also, if you discover that a passive income stream will
mean you have to live on less money than otherwise, it's healthy to
remind yourself of the benefits you are buying for the decreased
paycheck.

# Designing Your Value

Business, as I see it, is producing something that other people want
enough to pay for, at a low cost in time/effort/money on your behalf,
and then finding those people who will pay for that product, also at a
low cost in time/effort.

That leads to the two most basic questions
1. What do your current talents, or those you have enough interest to develop,
   enable you to produce, cheaply, that other people will pay for? 
2. How do you propose to locate, convince and deliver to these
   paying persons? In short I'll call this your "reaching". Others call
    it marketing, but I find this term more descriptive and realistic.

I graduate college with a law degree. Went to work in a UK law firm as
an intern and shrunk at the thought of how repetitious and boring it
would be to sit in the same office for 35 years. No wages, no matter how
handsome, could cause me to sacrifice my youth and my lust for
adventure, and I realised that I did not want to be a corporate lawyer.

Around this time I saw 4HWW in the bookshop, flipped through it, and
fell in love with the idea. I never bought or read the book: all I
needed was the spark of knowing that it was possible to earn money
in a location-free, low-time-commitment manner. There's something in
human nature, just *knowing* it can be done, empowers a person to
achieve what was previoulsy impossible to them. For this reason after
one person breaks a world record in sports, many others follow soon
after.

When I finished college I spent a week with pen and paper evaluating
potential passive income streams.

I brainstormed on what value I could provide. What were my skills, my
interests, my assets (e.g. the thousands of pages of notes I had
accumulated in college), the prospects within my social network (e.g. I
had a friend in Bolivia that wanted to import wood into Europe and
needed a contact).

Then I examined the value creation sources and asked myself how I could
potentially deliver my valuable product to people in a manner that
allowed me to be location free and time free. (At this time I didn't
think about the freedoms with as much granularity as I do today). 

One of the ideas on my list that didn't make the cut was "College
Admissions tutor". I believed that local parents would pay top euro for
assistance in getting their child into a prestigous university. I
believes I could reach the customers through advertising at fee-paying
secondard schools for rich kids and through advertising in local papers,
so I thought myself to have reachability covered. However I would not be
location free because I'd need to be in a room with these kids (this was
when Skyping was still v. choppy and the idea of Skype tutorials
farfetched.) Also temporal freedom not so much, since I would still earn
per power.

One of the most powerful slogans I developed for scoring my options was
that the ideal income stream would be one where I produce once then sell
many times. Professional writers, like Adam, embody this position, but I
didn't believe myself to have a book worth reading in me. But I had
about 200 hours hobby programming experience and I felt I could cobble
together an income stream or two.

I started by building directory websites. The website's were simple
enough for an extremely amateur program, and the business model was easy
for me to get my head around. You're a lawyer in Ireland, you have no
website, you pay 50 euros a year for your place. The telephone directory
had a list of every lawyer in the country's office, and there were
magazines circulated to the Irish legal community, both of which meant
that I had "reach" covered. I built this website over a few weeks, and
I'm ashamed to admit this, I didn't have the courage to release it and
market it. I felt intimated and socially anxious. Ridiculous, in
retrospect, but I mention it because your self-confidence, or rather
lack of, will crush any chances you have of 4HWW.

I set my sights lower than marketing to the legal community, and
modified the original directory website to showcase private secondary
school tutors instead of lawyers. Johnny is bad at Math - use this
website's search function to find a teacher in your town to teach him
after school. 40 euro/year. I read up on SEO and optimised with a few
tricks then launched. A fortnight later or so I got my first sale, and
oh boy did that feel good to earn something directly from the market,
without a middleman, and all of my own design and doing. I felt such
pleasure at the achievement.

I had a few more sales from this website, but it only ever made a couple
of hundred euros. Meanwhile I had this burst of inspiration that I'd put
my old law notes from Oxford on a basic HTML website and see if people
would buy them. It took me nine days to design the website, write the
copy, get a shopping cart plugin working, create free samples and
eventually launch. I sat back and waited but, unlike with my other
website nothing happened. 

At the time I was watching the TV show "The Wire" and one of the
characters, Proposition Joe, said something that really resonated with
me "Buy for a dollar, sell for two". Although I took the meaning a
little out of context, the message for me was that you need to spend
some money to make money. So, with great reluctance, I decided to pay
for online advertising via Google Adwords.

And when I did it was magic. It was like switching on a hose of money.
It being a new product that no-one yet owned, I sold a couple of
thousand euros worth of the notes the first month, so much that I
flew to Japan and operated the website while on the go, then spent
three months in Bolivia, having a blast, doing the same. Sure, I paid
Google a large proportion of my money, but I wouldn't have gotten
anything without advertising, so I was happy with the partnership.

Ever since I've lived on Oxbridge Notes— I developed the website and had
to find a way to get fresh notes every year in various subjects,
but I figured out ways of doing it, and in exchange for my risktaking
and thought, I've been rewarded a dream 20s, one in which I indulged my
interested, travelled extensively, no boss.

That's the big picture. Let me now move onto some details that I wish I
knew.

# Pointers

## Build Your Income Stream From the Ground Up Using Fresh Web Accounts
I put everything on my personal gmail account - perhaps 15 services I
rely upon, such as my web server hardware, my Paypal account, my Google
Docs, whatever. Then, once I hired an assitant, I had to switch all my
accounts, sometimes with great annoyance, to a new info@oxbridgenotes
account. I advise you all to being your passive income journey by
creating

## Be Productivity Obsessed
Productivity has the stereotypical image of a hyper-caffeinated yuppie
with 12 tabs open on a browser and wireless headset phone. That's
ridiculous. Real productivity, or the type you are concerned with, is
finishing and shipping a finished product in as little time as possible.
This involves a host of skills, including ability to make decisions,
knowledge on all the components required to finish the project,
emotional strength to release something into the public eye, priorities
your own time so as to do only the necessary tasks.

### Productivity Most Important
* If you can save 3 minutes in the future by spending 1 minute now, then
  do it now.
* Automate the shit out of anything repetitive. (software, people)
## Compress your time at the workstation
### Figure out what you need to do minimum attached to a computer
### Do 8 hours or work in 2.
### Put in places software and routines to block the others. 
E.g. I check my email twice a day because otherwise the speed of email
correspondence increases and my time is eaten up.
### Say "No" to business coffees
### Say "No" to fridge products or oddball customer requests. 
Don't do everything the customer asks for, instead do whatever you can
provide efficiently

## Systematise everything
All businesses, at penalty of imprisonment, require reporting of
accounts to the government. So, at minimum you'll need a system
for this. More likely, your passive income stream will require a couple
of other systems for maintenance. In the case of Oxbridge Notes I
require systems for evaluating whether new notes are any good, for placing
them online in a manner that's good for SEO, and for running online advertising to recruit
new authors every summer.


## Religious keeping of receipts and business expenses
A disciplined approach to expensing equipment (monitors, laptops),
web-services, home-office expenses and business-related travel (be that
within Berlin or abroad), can dramatically cut down your tax bills,
leaving you to enjoy a higher percentage of take home pay on a smaller
income.


## Every customer service question means that there's a problem with your website
If three customers asks me over a two-month period "how many pages are
in this ebook", then that indicates that I should include that
information on the webpage. Practicing this discipline of adding
the relevant information to the right place, has led my business to have
approximately one customer service question per 750 euro of notes sold.

## Online Marketing is the killer skill

I was tempted to say programming, for that is the study of automation—
and programming is damn important, but you can use lots of great tools,
such as Wordpress, and get the benefits of programming without deep
knowledge. With online marketing, however, you don't get to partake in
the much of the benefits without knowing how it works. I didn't make a
penny in my business until I started using Google Adwords. With my
Bolivian newspaper we didn't make a single sale until we emailed 20
university mailing lists. SEO, Adwords, Facebook advertising, email
marketing and social media marketing will help you make sales passively.
Without using these discipliens it's like setting up a physical
brick-store, say an IKEA, on an island in the middle of the ocean,
telling no-one about it, and expecting customers to throng to the doors.
You will get exactly the number of customers you direct to your website,
and, owing to the vagueness of the area, I find the most difficult part
of the business to get solid information on or to make decisions in.
Nevertheless it works, and you need to dive in. Hell, even if your
passive income stream fails you can live happily location free and on a
high hourly wage through online marketing freelancing, so think of it as
a wise investment.

## Switch Hats Regularly. Product Hardhat/Marketing Straw Hat/Strategy Beret
The problem you want to avoid is ploughing all your time into one one
narrow part of your income stream whilst avoiding the others. It's too
easy to get sucked up into the tasks you enjoy most (be that writing,
programming) whilst avoiding the harder, more "work"-like tasks that
drain you energy but are necessary to finish work quickly.

# Performance Preparation
* Print outline
* Rehearse outloud three times
* Record yourself rehearsing it slowly, wathcing for filler words and
  too much speed
* Imagine looking into the eyes of audience members for two full seconds
* Talk to some audience before starting

# Goals
Educate audience on work-practices that will save them time
Inspire them that it can be done
Set expectations for how long it will take
Tell my story
