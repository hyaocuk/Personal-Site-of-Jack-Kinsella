title: Textmate to Vim
subtitle: A guide to using your favourite Textmate features in Vim
/* published: false*/

When I switched from Textmate to Vim I could get nothing done. I didn't know how to replicate my favourite features, such as CMD T to find a file, or ESC to autocomplete a method name. I a few weeks searching the internet for solutions and now can do anything I did in Textmate in Vim.

This guide isn't about the powerful features VIM has over-and-above Textmate. It's merely a guide to doing what you used to do in Textmate in VIM. This is appropriate; when someone first swtiches to VIM they are not fully ready for the VIM way of mind. A milder learning curve is gained by using VIM like Textmate at first, and then going hardcore.

Some preliminary assumptions:
# You've installed MAC VIM: 
@brew install macvim@
# You know the basics of VIM. Type vimtutor in your terminal for a tutorial. Further training can be found be referring to the "vim training resources below":#vim_training_resources .
# You were a poweruser of Textmate keyboard shorcuts
# You've installed "Janus":https://github.com/carlhuda/janus, the community maintained distro of plugins and useful configurations for web programmers

_Parts of this guide are intended for the web app developer using Ruby On Rails. If you a Rails programmer you will still find 70% of this guide useful so don't look away yet._

Sometimes you will need to create customer commands in ~/.vimrc.local anything you place. To save yourself this just download my own version.

Somtimes you will need to install extra plugins. These go in your janus.rake file
