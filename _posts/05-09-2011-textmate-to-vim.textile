Assumptions:
1) You're using a Mac
2) You've installed Janus
3) You are in Normal Mode for all commands unless specified
4) Key 1 + Key 2 means both at same time | kw means k followed quickly by w|

Sometimes you will need to create customer commands in ~/.vimrc.local anything you place. To save yourself this just download my own version.

Somtimes you will need to install extra plugins. These go in your janus.rake file
