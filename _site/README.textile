h1. Personal Blog of Jack Kinsella, a "rails developer in London":http://www.jackkinsella.ie/rails-developer-london.html

h3. How to change posts

rvm use ruby-1.8.7-head
gem install jekyll RedCloth
jekyll --auto --server
git commit
git push heroku

h3. Why Use This Version

* Heroku Ready
* Standard portfolio website format with homepage, blog, and search-engine optimised about page.

h3. How to blog effectively

* Write long well thought out posts. 
* Try and create language, new ideas, or come up with Schema
* A reference page will get many links

h3. How to market a new post

* Don't post at tea time Silicon Valley (possibly.. when I posted automating popularity at this time it got drowned out)
* Post on Facebook as a link (since that allows tracked sharing). Custom descriptions automatically transform a link into a wall post, so don't do this
* Post on Twitter
* Post on a relevant sub-reddit
* Post on Hackernews
* Do some searches and find relevant stack overflow posts and blog posts on the topic. Either engage the author or write a comment.
* By having a relationship with someone else in the area you can ask them to Tweet it. Proactively reach out to community leaders and people you just straight up like.
