<h2 id="services">Professional Services Offered</h2>
<p>I am a full-stack web developer who builds web applications such as <a href="http://www.oxbridgenotes.co.uk">Oxbridge Notes</a> and <a href="http://www.hiredhelp.ie">Hired Help</a>. I have four years experience with Ruby and the Ruby on Rails web framework and it associated technologies, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> protocol, Linux, the cloud infrastructure, and, to a lesser albeit growing extent, Javascript.</p>
<h2 id="why_hire">Why Hire Me?</h2>
<h3>Technical Competence</h3>
<p>I have a track record of building, deploying, and maintaining web applications such as those in my <a href="/portfolio.html">portfolio</a>. I attend <a href="http://scottishrubyconference.com/">Ruby conferences</a> and <a href="http://rubyireland.com/">Ruby meetups</a>. I&#8217;ve contributed to over fifteen <a href="https://github.com/jackkinsella">open source projects</a>, I <a href="/blog.html">blog about Ruby</a>, I answer programming questions in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/286286/jack-kinsella">forums</a>, and I&#8217;m writing a book on Rails best practices. I&#8217;m a smart all rounder, as evidenced by scoring the highest possible result in state examinations and by winning a place at Oxford University.</p>
<h3>Reliable, Bug Free Code</h3>
<p>I practice <span class="caps">TDD</span>, which means, amongst others things, that I design my software in a way that it can automatically verify itself following every release. This means you won&#8217;t have to hire a tester to manually run through every page in a browser. Although <span class="caps">TDD</span> takes more time than conventional coding, the safeguards against bugs make it the coding practice of choice for those who demand high quality stable software, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Google,and 37Signals.</p>
<h3>Open Source Technology</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m familiar with the key open-source libraries in Ruby/Rails, and I use these in place of writing custom code. Less custom code means I spend less time building your application and you receive a smaller bill for my services.</p>
<h3>Advice on Key Technical Considerations</h3>
<p>A web programmer&#8217;s job isn&#8217;t just to program; his job is also to advise on technical considerations and online business.</p>
<p>Drawing from my experience seeing projects grow from napkin scribbles to unmanned money-making machines, I try to point out key features that you may be omitting, and, equally, expensive but pointless functionality you might want to include. Here is a small sample of the issues on which I will advise:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><span class="caps">SEO</span> strategy</strong>: By far the cheapest traffic comes through high ranks in organic search. Through years of experimentation I&#8217;ve found a technique to increase organic traffic dramatically, three-fold in the most recent case. I will help you build <span class="caps">SEO</span> into the core of your application. Having the greatest web app on the net means nothing if no-one ever finds it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Tracking Key Performance Indicators</strong>: The three big advantages of doing business online are automation of repetitive tasks, low overheads, and <strong>the ability to track and analyse data</strong>. By monitoring KPIs such as sign ups, uploads, sales in a particular category and time spent on individual pages, you can make informed decisions about your business, leading to a competitive edge.  I&#8217;ll advise you on how to integrate tracking at every level of your application, and display the data in a summary form you can easily digest.</li>
	<li><strong>Backup Solutions</strong>: Losing your customer&#8217;s data will ruin your business&#8217;s reputation and may even force you to shut down your business. I&#8217;ll discuss and implement an appropriate backup solution for your application.</li>
	<li><strong>Security Against Hacking</strong>: Hacked accounts and leaked personal details will cost your business dearly. I use the latest security best practices to prevent common hacks, such as <span class="caps">SQL</span> injection, Cross-Site-Forgery, Cross-Site-Scripting and Mass Assignment overrides.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working with computers ever since my father brought home a green-text-on-black-background terminal when I was four years old. Over the years I taught myself to program through tinkering, studying <a href="http://www.cc2e.com/">classic texts in computer science</a>, and watching <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm"><span class="caps">MIT</span> open courseware</a> lectures in math and computer science.</p>
<p>Given my lifelong interest I didn&#8217;t see the need to pursue computer science at third level, and so I chose to study law at <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford</a>. I took my studies seriously and learned a great deal about economics, politics and legal issues, and I gained written and verbal clarity through my efforts to improve my communication skills.</p>
<p>I scored one of the highest results in Ireland in the Leaving Certificate, earning As in math, physics, chemistry, biology and English and French.</p>
<p>I speak fluent Spanish, having lived in Spain and worked in Bolivia.</p>
