<h2 id="services">Professional Services Offered</h2>
<p>I am a full-stack <strong>Rails Developer</strong> who builds web applications such as <a href="http://www.oxbridgenotes.co.uk">Oxbridge Notes</a> and <a href="http://www.hiredhelp.ie">Hired Help</a>. I have deep experience with the Ruby and the Ruby on Rails web framework and its associated technologies: <span class="caps">CSS</span>, the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> protocol, Linux, cloud infrastructure, and Javascript.</p>
<h2 id="why_hire">10 Reasons To Hire Me</h2>
<p>1.	I’m fast. I built and deployed one app per week for my previous client. I stay fast by keeping a deck of 6000 programming flashcards which I keep in constant rotation</p>
<p>2.	I specialize in Ruby on Rails, and by this I mean I’m competent in Ruby, Rails 3.1, JavaScript, coffeescript, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, Html, Linux, deployment with multi-server architectures, asynchronous requests, regular expressions, <span class="caps">TDD</span>, <span class="caps">VIM</span>, jQuery, refactoring, design patterns, git, and sql.</p>
<p>3.	My code is clean. I’ve already written the first draft of an upcoming book on Ruby on Rails best practices.</p>
<p>4.	I’m practical. I’m not the kind of engineer who will waste your time and money perfecting architecture till the end of your budget. I’m the guy you want to hire to rapidly prototype something at a reasonable cost so that you can go and raise money right now.</p>
<p>5.	I take pride in my work. I’m ashamed of bugs and I won’t let them creep into projects with my name on them.</p>
<p>6.	I’m aware of my own cost, and my goal as a consultant is to offer you the most value per dollar, not to bill the maximum number of hours. I will suggest technical compromises to your spec where we swap ideal functionality for cheaply implemented functionality. You can always add the ideal case when you raise your first million.</p>
<p>7.	I know the Facebook platform inside out. I’m equally familiar with Spree, an open source e-commerce platform allowing you to create stores that sell online – be that digital goods or otherwise.</p>
<p>8.	I studied at and graduated from Oxford University.</p>
<p>9.	I know a lot about marketing, having built viral Facebook apps, having managed Facebook and Google advertising campaigns for over 2 years, and having done heavy <span class="caps">SEO</span> work. I will imbue your app with sensible optimizations that will make marketing your app, and ultimately making money, much simpler.</p>
<p>10.	I can build your web app alone, although I prefer to work with a graphic designer since your end results will be better for the same cost.</p>
<p>I have a track record of building, deploying, and maintaining web applications such as those in my <a href="/portfolio.html">portfolio</a>. I attend <a href="http://scottishrubyconference.com/">Ruby conferences</a> and <a href="http://rubyireland.com/">Ruby meetups</a>. I&#8217;ve contributed to over fifteen <a href="https://github.com/jackkinsella">open source projects</a>, I <a href="/blog.html">blog about Ruby</a></p>
<h2>More About What I Do</h2>
<h3>Reliable, Bug Free Code</h3>
<p>I practice <span class="caps">TDD</span>, which means, amongst others things, that I design my software in a way that it can automatically verify itself following every release. This means you won&#8217;t have to hire a tester to manually run through every page in a browser. Although <span class="caps">TDD</span> takes more time than conventional coding, the safeguards against bugs make it the coding practice of choice for those who demand high quality stable software, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Google,and 37Signals.</p>
<h3>Open Source Technology</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m familiar with the key open-source libraries in Ruby/Rails, and I use these in place of writing custom code. Less custom code means I spend less time building your application and you receive a smaller bill for my services.</p>
<h3>Advice on Commerial Considerations</h3>
<p>A web programmer&#8217;s job isn&#8217;t just to program; his job is also to advise on technical considerations and online business.</p>
<p>Drawing from my experience seeing projects grow from napkin scribbles to unmanned money-making machines, I try to point out key features that you may be omitting, and, equally, expensive but pointless functionality you might want to include. I&#8217;m one of the only Rails developers in London who offers this service. Here is a small sample of the issues on which I will advise:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><span class="caps">SEO</span> strategy</strong>: By far the cheapest traffic comes through high ranks in organic search. Through years of experimentation I&#8217;ve found a technique to increase organic traffic dramatically, three-fold in the most recent case. I will help you build <span class="caps">SEO</span> into the core of your application. Having the greatest web app on the net means nothing if no-one ever finds it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Tracking Key Performance Indicators</strong>: The three big advantages of doing business online are automation of repetitive tasks, low overheads, and <strong>the ability to track and analyse data</strong>. By monitoring KPIs such as sign ups, uploads, sales in a particular category and time spent on individual pages, you can make informed decisions about your business, leading to a competitive edge.  I&#8217;ll advise you on how to integrate tracking at every level of your application, and display the data in a summary form you can easily digest.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Backup Solutions</strong>: Losing your customer&#8217;s data will ruin your business&#8217;s reputation and may even force you to shut down your business. I&#8217;ll discuss and implement an appropriate backup solution for your application.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Security Against Hacking</strong>: Hacked accounts and leaked personal details will cost your business dearly. I use the latest security best practices to prevent common hacks, such as <span class="caps">SQL</span> injection, Cross-Site-Forgery, Cross-Site-Scripting and Mass Assignment overrides.</li>
</ul>
