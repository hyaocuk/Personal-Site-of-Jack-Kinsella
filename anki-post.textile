h2. What is Anki

The creators of Anki describe it as a "Spaced Repetition System", which means...
Used correctly, it can be so much more. The JANKI method helps programmers eliminate repeat error, learn from their mistakes, catalogue their knowledge, draw analogies between disparate subjects, design away from their computer, give continuing inspiration, and of course, program much faster. 

h2. How to do the JANKI Method?

The JANKI method starts with ANKI, an open source spaced reptition system available for free download. You begin method by creating a deck, say "Computer Science". A deck contains many facts, and each fact consists of a question, an answer, and a number of tags. For example, you might have the following fact:

What linux command lists all running processes?
====================
ps

Tags: linux

Although ANKI can download shared decks, letting you use sets of facts created by others, the JANKI method forbids you to do this since this diminishes your ability to learn. Instead you must create you own decks, drawing from your experiences programming, interesting code snippets you read, insightful blog posts, documentation for libraries, and, most importantly of all, from mistakes you've made. JANKI will become your library of coding related knowledge, except unlike ordinary notesbooks, you're going to learn everything by heart.

Every morning ANKI computes a list of cards for you to revise that day. It's choice is based on the Supermemo algorithm, and the goal is for you to drill the cards the minimum number of times in your life so as to never forget them. You've probably head these figures thrown around before - you should revise 1 day after learning, then a week then a month, then 3 months, then a year and so on. RESEARCH (how many reps in life). The supermemo algorithm optimises the process in two ways. It classifies cards which you frequently get wrong as leeches and removes them from the deck, preventing you from wasting time on the pesky 2%. It also asks you how well you remember any given fact rangin from 0(forgot) to 3(easy recall). The amount of time until the next repetition is dependent on how well you remember a fact. Forget it and you'll be drilled in a minute later, say it was easy and it could be months. Telling Anki how well you remember a fact can be difficult, and the onus is on you to answer truthfully and attempt to calibrate the different eases of recall.

The JANKI method requies you log in to ANKI every morning and review your cards for ten minutes. In exchange
